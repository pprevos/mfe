* EDITED Preface
CLOSED: [2019-04-26 Fri 10:49]
A book about marketing written by an engineer might seem unusual. Engineering is after all mainly about designing and creating new things, while marketing is about changing the behaviour of people. My journey towards marketing took almost two decades. After graduation, I worked for a multinational marine engineering contractor, reclaiming land in Europe and Asia. That period of my career was largely a mathematical endeavour, motivated by maximising the efficiency and effectiveness of construction processes.

The needs and wants of the people who would eventually use the structures I helped to build were never a great concern. The technical issues took all of my attention. When returning to the Netherlands, I joined a government agency responsible for the national water infrastructure. In this job I started to cultivate an interest in the culture of organisations and how they deal with their customers or communities.

After completing a Bachelor of Arts, it was time to deepen my knowledge of management by undertaking an MBA. The marketing lectures by Professor Rhett Walker were a career-changing experience. Before taking this course, my views on marketing were largely shaped by the neo-Marxist philosophy, which perceives marketing as a source of many societal problems. When Professor Walker asked me to define marketing I facetiously said: "selling people things they don't need".

Rhett was not taken back by my response and convinced me that marketing encompasses more than selling for the sake of profits and creating false needs. I came to recognise marketing as a tool to maximise the value that organisations contribute to society.

While undertaking an MBA, I was also responsible for managing a team providing services to property developers. When I first started this task, relationships with developers were not very strong as we positioned ourselves as a regulatory authority instead of providing a service. Implementing the principles of marketing enabled me to improve the level of service given to the developers of land.

This experience caused a Copernican Revolution in my understanding what it means to be a civil engineer, moving towards integrating the humanities with the physical sciences. This broader thinking about marketing enabled me to combine my interest in the humanities with my profession. Combining the procedural thinking of engineering with the philosophical method of enquiry is a powerful pathway to foster innovation. This interest eventually resulted in a PhD in business and a book about applying marketing theory in water utilities.[fn:prevos2017]

Writing this book combines my professional experience as a water engineer with theoretical insights in the science and practice of marketing, inspired by the humanities. As an engineer, I am interested in how my profession influences society and how the theories of marketing can be applied to this industry to maximise value for the community. As a social scientist, I am interested in the role of marketing in contemporary society, with specific reference to public service. The combination of engineering and marketing are not as incompatible as it seems. Marketing is after all, in the words of Kotler and Levy (1969): "customer satisfaction engineering".

* EDITED Defining Marketing
** EDITED Marketing and Engineering
Marketing and engineering sometimes have a complicated relationship. The two professional groups have different educational backgrounds and work under incommensurable paradigms. Engineers consist of a single professional group with a formalised education in the physical sciences. Although there is variety between the types of engineering, the basic principles and processes are similar across the various disciplines. Marketers stem from more diverse backgrounds. Marketing theory and practice are grounded in the social sciences. 

These different theoretical foundations can lead to tensions because of the different perspectives on the same problem. The physical and social sciences require different ways of thinking. The prime consideration for a marketer is the customer's perception of the product or service that engineers create. Engineers are more often concerned with the internal mechanics of their work. In my work in the water industry, I have often heard engineers proclaim that the opinions of customers have less weight than their perspective.

The two professional groups sometimes have stereotypical views of each other. Qualitative research identified a range of stereotypes the two groups held about each other. Engineers perceived marketers to be arrogant and prone to exaggeration. They perceived marketers to be too emotional, not sufficiently concerned about details and lacking understanding of technology. Negative assessments were symmetrical between groups as marketers described engineers as being too rigid, lacking creativity and having unsuitable social skills. They also found engineers not to be customer-focused and lacking understanding of business requirements.[fn:keav]

Engineering education is becoming much more diverse than it was a few years ago. Engineering students commonly take subjects in business, but marketing is often ignored. A textbook about business skills for utility engineers discusses many different aspects of management, but it omits any reference to marketing. The author suggests that marketing, and other business skills such as ethics and human resources, are "peripheral to most issues facing utility engineers".[fn:brown] The author could not be more wrong about the role of marketing in engineering. Engineering projects are rarely undertaken for the sake of itself, but they are initiated to generate societal or private benefits. Understanding the relationship between these benefits and the engineering product or service is the domain of marketing.

[fn:brown] Brown, R.E. (2010). /Business Essentials for Utility Engineers/. Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press.

Misunderstandings about the nature of marketing and engineering are at the root of most of these tensions. This book is written for engineers to understand better how marketing can help them in their job. This book is also useful for marketers who like to discover their expertise can help engineers create better products and services.
** EDITED What is Marketing?
When asking random people to mention three words that they associate with marketing, they will most certainly say advertising. The scope of the marketing team in an engineering project is more often than not limited to promoting and selling the product or service designed and delivered by engineers. The scope of marketing is, however, broader than communicating with potential and existing customers.

The limited perspective that most people have or marketing is not a surprise. Advertising is ubiquitous, and unless you spend your time in a  cabin in the woods, you see thousands of branded messages each day. Just a simple stroll through the supermarket is like walking through, in the words of Rushkoff, a "blizzard of brands".[fn:rushkoff]

[fn:rushkoff] Rushkoff, Douglas. 2000. /Coercion: Why We Listen to What “They” Say/. New York: Riverhead.

Marketing is often viewed as synonymous with advertising and only applicable to organisations that maximise sales. Marketing is rightly blamed for being a driving force of wasteful consumerism that promotes false needs. While all these perspectives on marketing are real, this is only a limited view. This narrow perspective of marketing results in it being ignored as a useful tool for engineers. This chapter discusses the definition of marketing to show that marketing skills are indeed relevant to the work of engineers.

Many definitions of marketing exist. Just like any other social concept, it can mean different things to different people. Blogger Heidi Cohen has collected [[https://heidicohen.com/marketing-definition/][72 marketing definitions]] from professional and academic sources. These definitions cover a wide variety of interpretations.[fn:cohen]

[fn:cohen] Cohen, Heidi (2011). [[https://heidicohen.com/marketing-definition/][72 Marketing Definitions]]. /Actionable Marketing Guide/ (blog).

I have downloaded all these definitions and visualised them with a word cloud. The more often a word is used in these definitions, the larger the text. This diagram shows that marketing is about products and services and customers. Other words that stand out are communication, brand, media and many others. This analysis gives us a slightly better idea, but it is a bit centred around the old concept of marketing as a process to sell products and services to customers.


#+CAPTION: Word cloud of 72 marketing definitions.
[[file:../Images/Definition/marketingcloud.png]]

This analysis already shows that marketing is more than just advertising. The broadest definition of marketing comes from the American Marketing Association:

#+begin_quote
"Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."
#+end_quote

We can deconstruct this compact definition to make sense of it. The definition states that marketing is an activity, a set of institutions and processes. Institutions in this definition are recurring patterns of behaviour. 

The second part lists the types of behaviours in marketing: create, communicate, deliver and exchange. These words make clear that marketing is about an exchange between people, not something you do by yourself. 

The third part of the definition specifies the objective or marketing, which are offerings that have value. The definition does, however, not state what that means.

The last part defines who marketing is for: "customers, clients, partners and society at large". The beneficiaries of marketing have many labels. A university has students, a doctor has patients, an airline has passengers, and so on. The crucial part of this definition are the words "society at large". These last three words place an ethical obligation to ensure that marketing activities not only favour the few.

This definition is a justified creep of the scope of marketing from merely promoting products and building relationships to delivering value for other people. Looking at marketing this way brings it much closer to the activities of engineers.

Peter Drucker, the father of all management gurus, succinctly described the purpose of marketing:[fn:drucker1954]

[fn:drucker1954] Drucker, P.F. (1954). /The Practice of Management/. New York: Perennial Library. 

#+begin_quote
"Marketing is so basic that it cannot be considered to be a separate function. It is the whole business seen from the point of view of its final result, that is, from the customer's point of view."
#+end_quote
** EDITED Marketing for Engineers
This review of the definition of marketing shows that it has more to offer to engineers than spinning stories about how excellent a product or service is. Marketing adds a social dimension to engineering by viewing it from the perspective of the beneficiary. Every engineering project has a beneficiary outside of the project team itself. This could be either an internal customer, individual consumers or a community.

On the surface, all engineering is the same, but the discipline consists of many specialisations. The names of most types of engineering refer to the things that the engineers produce. A mechanical engineer solves mechanical problems, a software engineer develops computer code, and a chemical engineer creates new products using substances. The only type of engineering that does not refer to the thing it does is civil engineering. The word engineering is also used in other contexts such as social engineering, which is not a form of engineering but it comes close to some of the aims of marketing.

The term civil engineering reflects Peter Drucker's view of marketing. Civil engineering is done for the /civilis/, which is Latin for people. The objective of almost all civil engineering is to benefit society at large. Perhaps all engineering should be renamed to include the beneficiary and call it consumer engineering, or health engineering, military engineering and so on. These terms refer to the beneficiary of the process instead of focusing on the technicalities of the discipline.

My favourite definition of marketing is by Phillip Kotler and Sidney Levy. They wrote a seminal paper half a century ago in which they expanded the scope of marketing beyond the traditional concepts of pushing products. They successfully argued that marketing has outside beyond the corporate boardroom and is also used by public services, charities, politicians and so on. One of the most interesting statements in this paper concerning the topic of this book is that Kotler and Levy described marketing as "Customer-satisfaction engineering".[fn:kl69]

[fn:kl69] Kotler, P., & Levy, S. J. (1969). Broadening the concept of marketing. /Journal of Marketing/, 33(January), 10–15.

Their comparison of marketing with engineering is not as silly as it might sound at first glance. Engineering is a creative process to achieve objectives. Engineers use the physical sciences and mathematics to solve problems. Marketing is a form of engineering in the sense that it is a process that uses the social sciences and mathematics to achieve objectives. The prime aim of marketing, as we have seen previously, is to create value for beneficiaries.

Peter Drucker also recognises the role of engineers in the marketing process:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Marketing is the activity that informs the engineer, the designer and the manufacturing man what customers want."
#+END_QUOTE

This chapter shows how marketing and engineering are intertwined. The objective of both disciplines is to create value for beneficiaries. The engineer needs the marketer to understand the needs and wants of the customer. This understanding will help them design and build better products and services. The marketer needs to engineer to convert these needs and wants into a product or a service. Well-engineered products and services ensure that marketers sell useful and durable products.

** EDITED This book
This book discusses the principles of marketing from the perspective of the work done by engineers. As is the case with all books about principles, a large proportion of the text is about theoretical marketing concepts. Theories of marketing are very different from the theories of engineering. Engineering is an applied science that uses physical science and mathematics to achieve objectives. Marketing is an applied social science that uses mathematics sparingly. 

Engineers who understand the theoretical foundations will be able to apply this to their work. Most of engineering methodology is about using theoretical concepts and apply them in a real-world context. Social psychologist Kurt Lewin is famous for pioneering in the field of organisational psychology. He also is often cited for stating:

#+begin_quote
"a businessman once stated that ‘there is nothing as practical as a good theory".[fn:lewin]
#+end_quote

The remainder of this book consists of four short chapters that discuss various aspects of marketing from the perspective of an engineer. This book most certainly does not aim to provide a complete introduction to marketing for engineers but is simply a teaser to wet the reader's curiosity. These four chapters follow the AMA definition of marketing and close with a discussion about the relationship between marketing and engineering.

The next chapter discusses the basic principles of marketing theory and practices through the concept of the marketing mix. This is a heuristic model used by marketers to assist with managing the complexity of the value chain of a project. This chapter provides a brief overview of the practice of marketing and how this can relate to engineering.

The following chapter discusses the subjective topic of value. Value is always in the eye of the beholder, which makes marketing an inherently subjective concept. Engineers struggle with managing subjective information. The social sciences have developed robust methods to extract intelligence from subjective information. This chapter presents a model to assist engineers in understanding the value of their projects better.

The penultimate chapter delves into the broad and complex concept of customers. The human dimension is often the hardest to understand for those trained and skilled in the craft of engineering. Engineering problems follow a complex deterministic logic that can be controlled with mathematical models. The behaviour of people is not that simple and deterministic. This chapter seeks to provide some 'hard people skills'. These are the same as the often touted soft people skills but backed by social science.

The final chapter aims to summarise and synthesise the intricacies of using marketing in an engineering context. This chapter looks at the relationships between marketer and engineers. A strong working relationship between these two professional groups leads to engineering projects that add value to customers, the organisation itself and society overall.
* The Process of Marketing
** Introduction
It should be clear from the previous chapter that marketing is broader than selling and advertising. These forms for communication are the visible parts of the tip of the iceberg of the whole process of marketing. Before any promotion can take place, marketers need to consider a range of issues. Marketing is a process that creates value for beneficiaries, of which advertising is only a small part. If marketing is more than promotion, then what are these other activities? This chapter discusses the various aspects of marketing that need to be considered to create value.

The AMA definition states that marketing is a process that involves "creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging" products or services. 

Most introductory text books about marketing start with the marketing mix. This is a heuristic tool to structure marketing activities and ensure that the manager considers all relevant aspects of the project. The literature contains many different versions of the marketing mix. 

One of the most common models are the so-called 4Ps or marketing. This model is more than fifty years old and has stood the test of time. The model is most suitable for the design, production and sales of products. The 4Ps of marketing are:

- Product (creating)
- Promotion (communicating)
- Place (distribution)
- Price (exchange)

The terms in brackets show how the definition of marketing relates to the marketing mix. These four dimensions adequately describe the process of marketing products, but require some modification to incorporate intangible offerings, or services. In the 1980s, Booms and Bitner expanded this model to include three more Ps that describe specific aspects of services.[fn:mmxix] To account for the specific characteristics of services, the marketing mix has three further dimensions:

- People
- Process
- Physical evidence

[fn:mmix] Ref.

This chapter discusses each of these seven dimensions of the extended marketing mix and their relevance to engineering projects. These sections only provide a cursory introduction to the topic to motivate the reader to seek further sources of information. Each of these seven sections is potentially a complete university course in itself.
** Product
The marketing mix dimension most obvious to engineers is the product.

When designing services, the product is intangible, which places additional requirements. The share of services over products in the economy has increased steeply over the past few decades. The fast rise of the internet has disrupted the traditional economy of physical products and interactions.

An important aspect to understand is the different perspective that engineers and marketers have of a product or service. 
** Price
One of the common tasks of engineers is to estimate the cost of a project. The task of an engineer is to estimate and control the cost of the development of products and services. Within engineering, the price of a project is considered to be the estimated actual cost plus an allowance for risk and profit.

* Delivering value
A famous cliche in the English language is that "One man's trash is another man's treasure". This idiom evocatively states the same thing can be something valuable for one person, while being worthless for another. This fundamental truth in marketing is no better illustrated than in the world of art. What one person perceives as being just a canvas with random drips and drabs of paint is to another person an invaluable work of art. 

The concept of value is inherently 

The concept of value is inherently subjective but we can say something useful about it. Value is, in economic terms, the difference between benefits and cost. This economic conceptualisation is insufficient because it only incorporates the monetary dimension of value.

The most neural word for a customer as the recipient of value from the marketing process is beneficiary.
