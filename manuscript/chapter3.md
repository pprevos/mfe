## Value is subjective
A famous cliche in the English language is that "One man's trash is another man's treasure". This idiom evocatively states the same thing can be something valuable for one person, while being worthless for another. This fundamental truth in marketing is no better illustrated than in the world of art. What one person perceives as being just a canvas with random drips and drabs of paint is to another person an invaluable work of art.
