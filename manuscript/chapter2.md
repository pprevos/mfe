# The Process of Marketing
It should be clear from the previous chapter that marketing is broader than selling and advertising. These forms for communication are the visible parts of the tip of the iceberg of the whole process of marketing. Before any promotion can take place, marketers need to consider a range of issues. Marketing is a process that creates value for beneficiaries, of which advertising is only a small part. If marketing is more than promotion, then what are these other activities? This chapter discusses the various aspects of marketing that need to be considered to create value.

The AMA definition states that marketing is a process that involves "creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging" products or services. 

Most introductory text books about marketing start with the marketing mix. This is a heuristic tool to structure marketing activities and ensure that the manager considers all relevant aspects of the project. The literature contains many different versions of the marketing mix. 

One of the most common models are the so-called 4Ps or marketing. This model is more than fifty years old and has stood the test of time. The model is most suitable for the design, production and sales of products. The 4Ps of marketing are:

- Product (creating)
- Promotion (communicating)
- Place (distribution)
- Price (exchange)

The terms in brackets show how the definition of marketing relates to the marketing mix. This chapter discusses the four dimensions of the marketing mix and their relevance to engineering. 

These sections only provide a cursory introduction to the topic to motivate the reader to seek further sources of information. Each of these seven sections is potentially a complete university course in itself.

## Case Study

## Product
The marketing mix dimension most obvious to engineers is the product.

When designing services, the product is intangible, which places additional requirements. The share of services over products in the economy has increased steeply over the past few decades. The fast rise of the internet has disrupted the traditional economy of physical products and interactions.

An important aspect to understand is the different perspective that engineers and marketers have of a product or service. 

## Price
One of the common tasks of engineers is to estimate the cost of a project. The task of an engineer is to estimate and control the cost of the development of products and services. Within engineering, the price of a project is considered to be the estimated actual cost plus an allowance for risk and profit. 

While the engineer as an internal view of the cost of a product, marketing tries to look at this problem from the perspective of the 

Engineering estimates are always only the bottom bargain basement price for a product. The price determined by engineers is the lowest acceptable amount that an organisation 

I learned the difference between cost and willingness to pay early in my career. One of my first large tasks was to estimate the cost of a dredging project in West Africa. Me and the rest of the team of graduate engineers were very proud of our estimates and we were confident that the price we determined was close to perfect. We were surprised to see that the actual price paid by the client was much higher than our proposed bid. 

When I asked the manager responsible for the tender process I learned an important lesson. He told me that the business placed a much higher bid than our estimated price because there was not much competition in that part of the world. Dredging is an industry with a small number of competitors able to undertake large projects. None of the usual competitors had any equipment in the region and their cost would be much higher than ours. The bid manager used this intelligence to increase the price to the client, which resulted in a healthy profit.

Marketers use a large range of pricing strategies to find the right balance between willingness to pay, competitor prices, fixed cost, marginal cost and so on. 

Setting the best price is a complex process that includes many variables. Pricing serves to ensure business survival, maximise profits, prevent competition, increase sales, setting quality signals and so on.

Two methods that closely relate to technology are market skimming and market penetration



An interesting case study in pricing for a market is the Loctite 660 Quick Metal product. This product can cheaply repair worn-out seats, keys, splines, bearings or tapers without remachining. This small tube of putty can save hundreds of dollars because it can repair cracks in machinery.




The process of pricing a market offering determines the price that consumers will pay. The cost to a consumer is, however, more than just the monetary component. Other costs that a consumer might experience from purchasing and using a product or service is a time price or a psychological price. The chapter on Delivering Value discusses a more complete model of the price of market offerings.

## The Marketing Plan

The [Business Model Canvas](http://www.businessmodelalchemist.com/tools) by Alexander Osterwalder (Figure x) is a popular model to develop business plans. This model is a customer-focused template that considers all aspects of 

![Business Model Canvas, by Business Model Alchemist.](images/Business_Model_Canvas.png)

The basic structure of the canvas has four categories:
- Infrastructure: activities, resources and partners
- Offering: value propositions
- Customers: customer segments, channels and customer relationships
- Finances: costs and revenue

Each of the eight subcategories have their own box on the template, or canvas. The purpose of the canvas is to collaboratively create a business plan. You could hang an enlarged version of the canvas on a wall and invite your team to add suggestions to each of the eight categories.
