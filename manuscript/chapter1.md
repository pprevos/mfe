# Marketing and Engineering


## Marketing and Engineering
Marketing and engineering sometimes have a complicated relationship. The two professional groups have different educational backgrounds and work under incommensurable paradigms. Engineers consist of a single professional group with a formalised education in the physical sciences. Although there is variety between the types of engineering, the basic principles and processes are similar across the various disciplines. Marketers stem from more diverse backgrounds. Marketing theory and practice are grounded in the social sciences. 

These different theoretical foundations can lead to tensions because of the different perspectives on the same problem. The physical and social sciences require different ways of thinking. The prime consideration for a marketer is the customer's perception of the product or service that engineers create. Engineers are more often concerned with the internal mechanics of their work. In my work in the water industry, I have often heard engineers proclaim that the opinions of customers have less weight than their perspective.

The two professional groups sometimes have stereotypical views of each other. Qualitative research identified a range of stereotypes the two groups held about each other. Engineers perceived marketers to be arrogant and prone to exaggeration. They perceived marketers to be too emotional, not sufficiently concerned about details and lacking understanding of technology. Negative assessments were symmetrical between groups as marketers described engineers as being too rigid, lacking creativity and having unsuitable social skills. They also found engineers not to be customer-focused and lacking understanding of business requirements.[fn:keav]

Engineering education is becoming much more diverse than it was a few years ago. Engineering students commonly take subjects in business, but marketing is often ignored. A textbook about business skills for utility engineers discusses many different aspects of management, but it omits any reference to marketing. The author suggests that marketing, and other business skills such as ethics and human resources, are "peripheral to most issues facing utility engineers".[fn:brown] The author could not be more wrong about the role of marketing in engineering. Engineering projects are rarely undertaken for the sake of itself, but they are initiated to generate societal or private benefits. Understanding the relationship between these benefits and the engineering product or service is the domain of marketing.

Misunderstandings about the nature of marketing and engineering are at the root of most of these tensions. This book is written for engineers to understand better how marketing can help them in their job. This book is also useful for marketers who like to discover their expertise can help engineers create better products and 

## What is Marketing?
When asking random people to mention three words that they associate with marketing, they will most certainly say advertising. The scope of the marketing team in an engineering project is more often than not limited to promoting and selling the product or service designed and delivered by engineers. The scope of marketing is, however, broader than communicating with potential and existing customers.

The limited perspective that most people have or marketing is not a surprise. Advertising is ubiquitous, and unless you spend your time in a  cabin in the woods, you see thousands of branded messages each day. Just a simple stroll through the supermarket is like walking through, in the words of Rushkoff, a "blizzard of brands"[^rushkoff]

[^rushkoff] Rushkoff, Douglas. 2000. /Coercion: Why We Listen to What “They” Say/. New York: Riverhead.

Marketing is often viewed as synonymous with advertising and only applicable to organisations that maximise sales. Marketing is rightly blamed for being a driving force of wasteful consumerism that promotes false needs. While all these perspectives on marketing are real, this is only a limited view. This narrow perspective of marketing results in it being ignored as a useful tool for engineers. This chapter discusses the definition of marketing to show that marketing skills are indeed relevant to the work of engineers.

Many definitions of marketing exist. Just like any other social concept, it can mean different things to different people. Blogger Heidi Cohen has collected [[https://heidicohen.com/marketing-definition/][72 marketing definitions]] from professional and academic sources. These definitions cover a wide variety of interpretations.[^cohen]

[^cohen] Cohen, Heidi (2011). [[https://heidicohen.com/marketing-definition/][72 Marketing Definitions]]. /Actionable Marketing Guide/ (blog).

I have downloaded all these definitions and visualised them with a word cloud. The more often a word is used in these definitions, the larger the text. This diagram shows that marketing is about products and services and customers. Other words that stand out are communication, brand, media and many others. This analysis gives us a slightly better idea, but it is a bit centred around the old concept of marketing as a process to sell products and services to customers.

This analysis already shows that marketing is more than just advertising. The broadest definition of marketing comes from the American Marketing Association:

"Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."

We can deconstruct this compact definition to make sense of it. The definition states that marketing is an activity, a set of institutions and processes. Institutions in this definition are recurring patterns of behaviour. 

The second part lists the types of behaviours in marketing: create, communicate, deliver and exchange. These words make clear that marketing is about an exchange between people, not something you do by yourself. 

The third part of the definition specifies the objective or marketing, which are offerings that have value. The definition does, however, not state what that means.

The last part defines who marketing is for: "customers, clients, partners and society at large". The beneficiaries of marketing have many labels. A university has students, a doctor has patients, an airline has passengers, and so on. The crucial part of this definition are the words "society at large". These last three words place an ethical obligation to ensure that marketing activities not only favour the few.

This definition is a justified creep of the scope of marketing from merely promoting products and building relationships to delivering value for other people. Looking at marketing this way brings it much closer to the activities of engineers.

Peter Drucker, the father of all management gurus, succinctly described the purpose of marketing:[^drucker1954]

"Marketing is so basic that it cannot be considered to be a separate function. It is the whole business seen from the point of view of its final result, that is, from the customer's point of view."

## Marketing for Engineers
This review of the definition of marketing shows that it has more to offer to engineers than spinning stories about how excellent a product or service is. Marketing adds a social dimension to engineering by viewing it from the perspective of the beneficiary. Every engineering project has a beneficiary outside of the project team itself. This could be either an internal customer, individual consumers or a community.

On the surface, all engineering is the same, but the discipline consists of many specialisations. The names of most types of engineering refer to the things that the engineers produce. A mechanical engineer solves mechanical problems, a software engineer develops computer code, and a chemical engineer creates new products using substances. The only type of engineering that does not refer to the thing it does is civil engineering. The word engineering is also used in other contexts such as social engineering, which is not a form of engineering but it comes close to some of the aims of marketing.

The term civil engineering reflects Peter Drucker's view of marketing. Civil engineering is done for the /civilis/, which is Latin for people. The objective of almost all civil engineering is to benefit society at large. Perhaps all engineering should be renamed to include the beneficiary and call it consumer engineering, or health engineering, military engineering and so on. These terms refer to the beneficiary of the process instead of focusing on the technicalities of the discipline.

My favourite definition of marketing is by Phillip Kotler and Sidney Levy. They wrote a seminal paper half a century ago in which they expanded the scope of marketing beyond the traditional concepts of pushing products. They successfully argued that marketing has outside beyond the corporate boardroom and is also used by public services, charities, politicians and so on. One of the most interesting statements in this paper concerning the topic of this book is that Kotler and Levy described marketing as "Customer-satisfaction engineering".[^kl69]

[^kl69] Kotler, P., & Levy, S. J. (1969). Broadening the concept of marketing. /Journal of Marketing/, 33(January), 10–15.

Their comparison of marketing with engineering is not as silly as it might sound at first glance. Engineering is a creative process to achieve objectives. Engineers use the physical sciences and mathematics to solve problems. Marketing is a form of engineering in the sense that it is a process that uses the social sciences and mathematics to achieve objectives. The prime aim of marketing, as we have seen previously, is to create value for beneficiaries.

Peter Drucker also recognises the role of engineers in the marketing process:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Marketing is the activity that informs the engineer, the designer and the manufacturing man what customers want."
#+END_QUOTE

This chapter shows how marketing and engineering are intertwined. The objective of both disciplines is to create value for beneficiaries. The engineer needs the marketer to understand the needs and wants of the customer. This understanding will help them design and build better products and services. The marketer needs to engineer to convert these needs and wants into a product or a service. Well-engineered products and services ensure that marketers sell useful and durable products.
