# Marketing and Engineering
* Engineers and Marketers
Proponents of engineering often advocate that more people should be studying Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). In this book I promote that idea that engineers should be studying STEMS and add the social sciences to their corpus of knowledge.
** Physical Science versus Social Science

Fictional theoretical physicist Dr Sheldon Cooper loathes the social science, or any science that is not theoretical physical for that matter. In episode x of season y he said that "the social sciences are all hokum". 

** Internal marketing

** Engineering-Marketing Interface

** In conclusion
This ebook only provides a summary of marketing theory as it applies to the work of engineers. I would love to hear from any engineer and their experinces with 

Marketing and engineering sometimes have a complicated relationship. The two professional groups have different educational backgrounds and work under incommensurable paradigms. Engineers consist of a single professional group with a formalised education in the physical sciences. Although there is variety between the types of engineering, the basic principles and processes are similar across the various disciplines. Marketers stem from more diverse backgrounds. Marketing theory and practice are grounded in the social sciences. 

These different theoretical foundations can lead to tensions because of the different perspectives on the same problem. The physical and social sciences require different ways of thinking. The prime consideration for a marketer is the customer's perception of the product or service that engineers create. Engineers are more often concerned with the internal mechanics of their work. In my work in the water industry, I have often heard engineers proclaim that the opinions of customers have less weight than their perspective.

The two professional groups sometimes have stereotypical views of each other. Qualitative research identified a range of stereotypes the two groups held about each other. Engineers perceived marketers to be arrogant and prone to exaggeration. They perceived marketers to be too emotional, not sufficiently concerned about details and lacking understanding of technology. Negative assessments were symmetrical between groups as marketers described engineers as being too rigid, lacking creativity and having unsuitable social skills. They also found engineers not to be customer-focused and lacking understanding of business requirements.[fn:keav]

Engineering education is becoming much more diverse than it was a few years ago. Engineering students commonly take subjects in business, but marketing is often ignored. A textbook about business skills for utility engineers discusses many different aspects of management, but it omits any reference to marketing. The author suggests that marketing, and other business skills such as ethics and human resources, are "peripheral to most issues facing utility engineers".[fn:brown] The author could not be more wrong about the role of marketing in engineering. Engineering projects are rarely undertaken for the sake of itself, but they are initiated to generate societal or private benefits. Understanding the relationship between these benefits and the engineering product or service is the domain of marketing.

Misunderstandings about the nature of marketing and engineering are at the root of most of these tensions. This book is written for engineers to understand better how marketing can help them in their job. This book is also useful for marketers who like to discover their expertise can help engineers create better products and
