# Introduction
This book discusses the principles of marketing from the perspective of the work done by engineers. As is the case with all books about principles, a large proportion of the text is about theoretical marketing concepts. Theories of marketing are very different from the theories of engineering. Engineering is an applied science that uses physical science and mathematics to achieve objectives. Marketing is an applied social science that uses mathematics sparingly. 

Engineers who understand the theoretical foundations will be able to apply this to their work. Most of engineering methodology is about using theoretical concepts and apply them in a real-world context. Social psychologist Kurt Lewin is famous for pioneering in the field of organisational psychology. He also is often cited for stating:

>"a businessman once stated that there is nothing as practical as a good theory".[^lewin]

This book most certainly does not aim to provide a complete introduction to marketing for engineers but is simply a teaser to stimulate the reader's curiosity. 

The remainder of this book consists of four chapters about various aspects of marketing from the perspective of an engineer. 
1. What is marketing?
2. The marketing process
3. Delivering value
4. Understanding customers
5. Engineers and marketers

The next chapter defines marketing and how it relates to engineering. Many scholars and practitioners have proposed definitions of marketing. They all have in common that it is a process that creates value for customers. Marketing applies the social sciences, while engineering is about the physical sciences. The different in paradigms in engineering and marketing will be a recurring theme in this book.

Chapter three discusses the basic principles of marketing through the concept of the marketing mix. This is a heuristic model used by marketers to assist with managing the complexity of the value chain of a project. This chapter uses a case study to illustrate these principles. The chapter closes with a discussion on writing a marketing plan for your project.

The following chapter discusses the subjective topic of value. Value is always in the eye of the beholder, which makes marketing an inherently subjective concept. Engineers struggle with managing subjective information. The social sciences have developed methods to extract intelligence from subjective information. This chapter presents a model to assist engineers in understanding the value of their projects better.

The penultimate chapter delves into the broad and complex concept of customers. The human dimension is often the hardest to understand for those skilled in the craft of engineering. Engineering problems follow a complex deterministic logic that uses mathematical models. The behaviour of people is not that simple and deterministic. This chapter seeks to provides some 'hard people skills'. These are the same as the often touted soft people skills but backed by social science.

The previous chapters discussed the theoretical and practical implications of marketing theory on engineering practice. The final chapter looks at the relationships between marketers and engineers. A strong working relationship between these two professional groups leads to engineering projects that add value to customers, the organisation itself and society overall.
