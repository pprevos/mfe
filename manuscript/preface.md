# Preface
A book about marketing written by an engineer might seem unusual. Engineering is after all mainly about designing and creating new things, while marketing is about changing the behaviour of people through advertising and selling. Engineering applies the physical sciences, such as chemistry and physics, while marketing uses the social sciences of psychology and sociology. These are quite different domains of knowledge each with their own perspective on the world.

My journey towards marketing took almost two decades. After graduation, I worked for a multinational marine engineering contractor, reclaiming land in Europe and Asia. That period of my career was largely a mathematical endeavour, motivated by maximising the efficiency and effectiveness of construction processes.

The needs and wants of the people who would eventually use the structures I helped to build were never a great concern. The technical issues took all of my attention. When returning to the Netherlands, I joined a government agency responsible for the national water infrastructure. In this job I started to cultivate an interest in the culture of organisations and how they deal with their customers or communities. This interest led my to return to university to learn about cultures.

I did an arts degree purely out of personal interest and often joked to my colleagues that I enjoy studying useless subjects such as philosophy. Little did I know that this degree was to become very useful in my engineering work indeed.

After completing a Bachelor of Arts, it was time to deepen my knowledge of management by undertaking an MBA. The marketing lectures by Professor Rhett Walker were a career-changing experience. Before taking this course, my views on marketing were largely shaped by the neo-Marxist philosophy, which perceives marketing as a source of many societal problems. When Professor Walker asked me to define marketing I facetiously said: "selling people things they don't need".

Rhett was not taken back by my response and convinced me that marketing encompasses more than selling for the sake of profits and creating false needs. I came to recognise marketing as a tool to maximise the value that organisations contribute to society.

While undertaking an MBA, I was also responsible for managing a team providing services to property developers. When I first started this task, relationships with developers were not very strong as we positioned ourselves as a regulatory authority instead of providing a service. Implementing the principles of marketing enabled me to improve the level of service given to the developers of land.

This experience caused a Copernican Revolution in my understanding what it means to be a civil engineer, moving towards integrating the humanities with the physical sciences. This broader thinking about marketing enabled me to combine my interest in the humanities with my profession. Combining the procedural thinking of engineering with the philosophical method of enquiry is a powerful pathway to foster innovation. This interest eventually resulted in a PhD in business and a book about applying marketing theory in water utilities.[^prevos2017]

Writing this book combines my professional experience as a water engineer with theoretical insights in the science and practice of marketing, inspired by the humanities. As an engineer, I am interested in how my profession influences society and how the theories of marketing can be applied to this industry to maximise value for the community. As a social scientist, I am interested in the role of marketing in contemporary society, with specific reference to public service. The combination of engineering and marketing are not as incompatible as it seems. Marketing is after all, in the words of Kotler and Levy (1969): "customer satisfaction engineering".[^kotler1969]
